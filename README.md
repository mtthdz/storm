This is an Node & Express RESTful API.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to serve the API.

## Notes
- This is a Node.JS, Express and TypeScript API with no database.
- I chose to stand up my own API via Node to better demonstrate working knowledge of full stack environments and data fetching on the client
- Why not Bun? I simply haven't had a chance to experiment with Bun, and to save the team's time with potentially setting up bun just to test this project.
